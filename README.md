# The Effect of Bilingualism on Executive Function
## Executive summary

**Background**:

There is little existing research on the effect of bilingualism on children with autism (ASD). ASD is a gradated condition commonly associated with difficulties in verbal expression and executive functions. Current findings suggest that children's exposure to bilingualism will not exacerbate their ASD symptoms, contrary to parents' and clinicians' fears.

**Research Objective**:

This report investigates the effect of bilingualism as moderator or mediator on Executive Functions for bilingual children in the study as well as subsetting by gender and diagnosis.

**Data**:

89 bilingual families in Scotland with either TD or ASD children aged 5 to 13 volunteered to participate in a study consisting of a parent's report on their children as well as a battery of assessments performed with the child by a researcher.\\

**Methods**:

Factor analysis is used to identify a plausible model for measuring executive function. Causal Analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of bilingualism as moderator of the effect of ASD on executive functions as well as the influence of bilingualism as mediator between language ability and executive functioning. \\

**Results**:

Factor Analysis showed that a 7 metric, single latent factor model showed near perfect fit to the data. However, dimensionally reduced data according to this model showed no evidence of bilingualism having any moderation or mediation affect on executive functions.
